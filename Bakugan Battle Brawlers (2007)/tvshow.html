Dan gets off to a rocky start, but he and Ace are too evenly matched. With one win and one loss for each their battle ends in a tie and they become fast friends.

At the same time, Mylene also goes hunting for Bakugan, after throwing away three she claimed useless. In the morning, Marucho meets Aquos Elfin, a Bakugan who turned out to know and have what might be a crush on Preyas. She explains that after his capture, she had to watch over the forest and protect the Bakugan living there from any harm. When Marucho asks to be partners with her, she at first declines because she claims to be &quot;waiting for the right partner&quot;. But when Marucho explains that he needs her to help free the Bakugan (as this was what Preyas would have wanted) she says that if he passes her test, she will at least think about a &quot;temporary partnership&quot;. As the testing goes underway, with Marucho not doing so well, Mylene flies over, and in fury, Elfin and Marucho demand she and the Vexos return the stolen Bakugan. Angered at how cruel Mylene is to the Bakugan she already carries (by throwing them away like trash), Marucho and Elfin challenge her to a brawl. But Mylene soon begins to show her skill, and may end up winning Elfin as a new Bakugan! just when all of mylene's bakugan were no use, she unleshed a bakugan called a bakugan trap. Just when Mylene is about to seize Elfin, a hooded figure wielding Ventus Bakugan arrives and saves Marucho. Mylene states she's tired of losing to this hooded person and offers him to join the Vexos, but he leaves without saying a word and Mylene departs. Meanwhile, Marucho slowly awakens, despaired that Elfin was gone. But as it turned out, Elfin was merely off to find him some water, and then begins explaining how she couldn't let anything happen to her &quot;goofy partner&quot;. In the end, Elfin and Marucho are partners, able to aid the Resistance in their journey. Later, in episode 6, it is revealed that the hooded figure is Shun.

In the midst of the argument, Dan sneaks away with Drago to fight Gus and manages to battle well until Spectra joins in and Dan starts to struggle in the fight. Out of nowhere, Shun comes to his rescue. Shun beats Gus and Dan beats Spectra when Drago displays a massive power surge due to Helios' taunts about Tigrerra. Seeing that huge amount of power Spectra shows hint of betrayal when he said that he won't let the magnificent Bakugan become a play thing, meaning that he won't give it to Prince Hydron if he captures it. Back at the base, Shun explains that while he was in the mountains a portal opened up right in front of him and got sucked through to New Vestroia. After he rescues Ingram from the Vestals, she remained in his debt and the two banded together to free the Bakugan. As they make their way closer to Alpha City and the dimension controller, Dan asks why Shun didn't reveal himself earlier when he rescued Marucho. Shun explains that he had something important to attend. When they approched Alpha City, Shun revealed he'd break in the city and find his Skyress.

          <div class="plot">Ace and Shun team up in a Bakugan battle tournament in order to overload the dimension controller because it draws power from bakugan battles. After Marucho is disquaified in the singles round, he sneaks the others in. They almost get caught by some guards until Mira pretends to be a huge Vexos fan and they manage to slip away. As they remain hidden, the Vexos show up and Mira notices that Spectra tosses his Bakugan the same way as her lost brother Keith (later realize that Spectra might have somthing to do with the disappearance of Keith). Meanwhile, Ace and Shun are having trouble getting along in the battle tournament and are starting to lose against the Dark Angels who are Vexos wannabes. When their opponents begin taunting them, Shun and Ace put their differences aside and finally come up with a plan. They win with ease while claiming their opponent's Bakugan. Shun and Ace prepare for their match against Lync and Volt.

Things only get worse when they discover many other talking bakugan and then they are captured by guards who are marveled by the speaking Drago. Just then Marucho drops in and saves them. Things get worse for Shun and Ace when Lync combines his Ventus Altair with Ventus Wired and their bakugan traps seem to have no effect. Shun and Ace discover Altair's weakness: it cannot sense multiple opponents and they manage to destroy it. While the others hold off the guards, Dan makes his way to the controller, finding that it is guarded by lasers. He throws Drago through the lasers and he hits the reverse switch, destroying the controller just as Shun and Ace defeat Lync and Volt. The newly freed bakugan rise up from the ground and everyone in the stadium learn the truth about the bakugan.

Drago is no match for this power and loses, with Spectra claiming him as his prize. Dan is crushed by his defeat and the loss of his partner while Spectra walks by the same fortune teller who is shocked by how much darker his future has become. Once again, Spectra does not care.

Apollonir states that they must retrieve Drago as the Perfect Core is losing power and the other two dimension controllers are growing stronger. While training, Dan faints and develops a fever. He runs out into the park calling out to Drago, lamenting over how he lost Drago. All of a sudden, Apollonir shows up and to retrieve Drago, but Dan regrets to inform him that he lost Drago.

Dan tries to reach out to his friend, but it seems that Drago is unable to listen. Spectra uses the power of many forbidden cards to access Drago's Perfect Core abilities, but it puts Drago under mounds of stress. The legendary warriors conclude that Drago should not have been able to access the Perfect Core's power and change attribute while in his new body, but the power of the forbidden cards allows him to do so. Things look bad for Apollonir, as Drago seems unstoppable with all this power. Dan then notices that Drago is crying and that if he doesn't stop Spectra from giving Drago so much power, Drago could die. Apollonir believes that the only way to help Drago is to transform himself into pure energy and enter Drago's body to absorb the extra energy, however, Apollonir will not be able to attack or defend himself. Also, Dan must throw Apollonir into Drago's chest, but if he misses, Drago's condition could worsen and Dan may end up killing Drago and New Vestroia may turn back into six separate worlds. Dan successfully launches Apollonir into Drago's chest and Drago falls, defeated, returning to his normal self. Dan and Drago are happily reunited while Spectra does not seem that affected by the loss, and only insists that things will be different the next time they meet

They next head to the Vestal Palace to free all the original Guardian Bakugan and save New Vestroia for good.

            2x24 - Ultimate Bakugan
          </div>
          <div class="plot">With Mira returned, and the Resistance reunited, Dan and the others head for Prince Hydron's sky palace to free Skyress, Tigrerra, Preyas, Gorem, and Hydranoid from captivity. But before they can even get close enough, Hydron activates another dimension controller, causing the Bakugan to turn back into ball form. Quickly thinking, Shun grabs Mira and Marucho and grapples onto the top of a rising elevator and to safety. Down below, Dan, Baron, and Ace are saved just in time by their Bakugan. But before they can think of a way to get up to the palace, Spectra and Cyber Helios challenge them to a battle. As Dan and Drago struggle to fight back against the power Helios now possesses, Shun, Marucho, and Mira have managed to sneak into Hydron's throne room and discover the bronze statues of the five other Guardian Bakugan, just before meeting face to face with Prince Hydron himself. Meanwhile, Mylene, Volt, and Shadow order Dr. Clay to give them an escape off of New Vestroia, as the energy from the battle between Cyber Helios and Drago could destroy everything around them. Dr. Clay at first refuses saying that it would be treason, when Shadow reminds him he works for the Vexos now. Gus overhears their plan, but before he can warn Spectra, Lync hits him over the head and knocks him into a room, locking Gus inside so he can't tell Spectra of their plan. Back with Dan and Drago, Spectra, having underestimated the perfect core's power, has used the mechanical Bakugan he has to make Maxus Helios, a Bakugan who has all six attributes. Dan tries to use a combination of Ability Cards that tap into the Perfect Core's power, but still can't match Maxus Helios's power. Dan realizes he has no choice but to use the Bakugan he got from his battle with Mira to make Maxus Dragonoid, just as Spectra has again used the other six mechanical Bakugan on Helios. The two Bakugan face each other, preparing for the final battle.

She explains that they are leaving New Vestroia. Hydron refuses at first, being afraid to face his father due to his failure to successfully occupy New Vestroia, but agrees to Mylene's plan to label Spectra as a traitor. Meanwhile, Mira, Marucho and Shun try to activate a machine to reverse the process of Preyas, Gorem, Tigrerra, Hydranoid and Skyress's petrification but are unable to determine the numeric code. Dan and Drago take to the skies to battle Spectra and Helios but the power coming from their battle is far too much and they crash into the palace. Mylene prepares for their departure from New Vestroia but not before tossing out Elico and Brontes, believing that Bakugan with feelings are useless and imperfect fighting machines, since Dr. Clay has already created many powerful mechanical Bakugan. Out of a stroke of luck, Elfin discovers the activation code, but with the palace self destruction under way it may be too late.

          <div class="plot">As Dan and Spectra continue their battle, and the self destruct sequence begins counting down, the rest of the six fighting Bakugan are freed from their prisons. As Shun and Marucho are reuinted with Skyress and Preyas, the Bakugan in Dan and Spectra's battle suddenly return to ball-like states, and the battle ends in a tie. But CyberHelios wants to continue fighting, even if the battle is over. Cyber Helios and Drago engage just as Ace and Baron, riding on Percival and Nemus, meet up with Shun, Marucho, Mira, and the rest of the six fighting bakugan. As Cyber Helios and Drago battle, Spectra draws a blade, and forces Dan to battle him one on one. Before either battle can reach a conclusion, the Vestal palace explodes, barely giving Dan and Drago any time to escape as Spectra and Cyber Helios retreat with Gus, Brontes, and Elico (whom were thrown out of the escape craft by Mylene). Gus immediately informs Spectra that the others left New Vestroia to blame the occupation's failure entirely on Spectra's betrayal. Spectra merely states that he never really planned on returning to the Vestal home world anyways. Meanwhile, the Resistance celebrates their victory of liberating New Vestroia and freeing the bakugan. Mira, Ace, and Baron decide to return to their world to prevent the Vexos from ever returning to New Vestroia and enslaving the Bakugan again. The others decide to return to Earth with their Bakugan and the original fighting Bakugan, but Skyress declines the offer, saying that she can't bear to leave her home again and that Shun's future lies with Ingram. Right after Skyress leaves, Drago and Dan regrettably inform Marucho and the others that Drago cannot leave New Vestroia, as the Perfect Core is a part of him. But then Apollonir and the rest of the legendary soldiers appear and grant Drago freedom to live wherever he pleases, with the ability to go back and forth between the worlds as he wishes. With that, Dan, Marucho, Shun, and the rest of the Bakugan return to Earth. Various portals open up across the world, allowing Alice and Julie to reunite with their Bakugan. Dan arrives at Runo's family's cafe and tells her New Vestroia has been saved. Just as he believes Runo is about to run to him, she scoops up Tigrerra, reunited with her Bakugan as well. Highly embarrassed, Dan yells at Drago to never speak of this again. Marucho and Shun walk in with their respective Bakugan, and Julie joins the group shortly afterwards. The Bakugan Battle Brawlers are back together again.

At first the six ancient warriors are doing great until Zenoheld combines his Mechanical Bakugan and easily overpowers the warriors. In a last ditch attempt, the ancient warriors vanish and summons Drago, Elfin, Ingram, Wilda, Nemus and Percival and their partners to give the six bakugan their attribute powers, causing them to evolve. Dan, Marucho, Shun and Mira wake up to find their Bakugan have truly evolved, and realize that New Vestroia is in danger.

After the battle Dan, Shun, Ace and Baron fall asleep during the movie that they were watching.  No-one else knew Elfin lost the Aquos Energy.

After insisting she feels nothing for Billy anymore, Julie practically leaps into his arms when he arrives seconds later and introduces him to Mira, Ace and Baron. Billy is apparently caught up with everything happening after running into Klaus a while back and receiving a gauntlet from him. Not long after, Marucho's preparations for a virtual battle chamber called Bakugan Interspace are complete. The system allows anyone from all over the world play Bakugan like a game by logging on to the web. Everyone is eager to test out the machine, except for Shun, saying he has something important to take care of. Everyone draws straws to determine who goes first and Ace and Billy are chosen. Mira and Runo accidentally reveal Julie's crush on Ace to Billy and Ace, not wanting to come between the two, offers to take them both on, which they accept. As the battle rages on, Julie notices that Billy has become much stronger than before after easily defeating Percival. However, Ace easily counters back with the help of his newly evolved Trap Flash Falcon Fly. Meanwhile, Shun checks the security tapes and notices Shadow and Mylene following Billy to Marucho's house. Despite their advantage in numbers, Billy and Julie fall to Ace. After the battle, Shun urges them to return and shows them the picture of Mylene and Shadow from the security footage.

They plan to storm the Mother Palace and directly attack the Bakugan Termination System instead of protecting the Attribute Energies. But without a working Dimensional Transport system or the coordinates to the Mother Palace, it at first seems there would be no way out for the brawlers. But Dan quickly realizes that they can find the location of the Mother Palace by convincing Spectra. The brawlers are hesistant, as Spectra will not likely be cooperative, and they have no way to contact him. Mira adds that there would be no way Keith would trust any of them. Meanwhile, the Vexos discover that someone has opened a portal to Earth from an entirely different universe. As Spectra makes his way to Earth, Dan and Drago admit how similar they are in both brawling abilities and lifestyles. When Runo interrupts the two for dinner, Dan and Drago are suddenly transported to Spectra's ship now that the former Vexos had broken through to Earth. Once there, Dan learns that Spectra needs the Perfect Core from Drago in order to make Helios the ultimate bakugan. They strike a deal: if Spectra loses, he will take the Resistance to the Mother Palace, but if Spectra wins, Dan must willingly surrender the Perfect Core to Spectra. During the battle Spectra realizes that the only way Helios can defeat Drago is by using his own natural abilities and powerful will to survive and evolve. Eventually Spectra's doubt in himself and his previous methods to perfect Helios leads to his defeat. Dan wins the fight and Spectra agrees to the terms of the bet. Everyone except Runo, Julie and Billy are transported to Spectra's ship, since he states that he would only allow the brawlers and bakugan originally bestowed with the Bakugan Attribute Energies to go with him. As Gus prepares the ship for the transport, Spectra thanks Dan for enlightening him, and refers to him as 'my friend'. Feeling humiliated after his defeat, Helios begs Spectra to make him even stronger. Spectra agrees, saying he will use the data he received on Bakugan evolution from an anonymous source to bring out new powers and new abilities from deep inside the Bakugan.

Spectra and Gus leave to confront Zenoheld and Spectra tells him to leave the brawlers be. Spectra leaves, but Gus later returns and challanges Zenoheld to a battle to avenge Spectra for being framed and betrayed by the Vexos. Gus' struggles in the battle become more obvious as both Elico and Hexados sacrifice themselves to protect Vulcan and Gus. In the final match, Vulcan protects Gus, saying that his loyalty to Gus knows no bounds like Gus' loyalty to Spectra. The two stand together and take Zenoheld's final hit and fall, dead.

A battle soon begins between Hydron and Dan and Mira, just as Spectra arrives to fight alongside Dan! Mira is quickly taken out just as the others arrive, too late to warn Dan about the Palace sending power to mechanical Bakugan. Spectra brings out his Battle Gear for Helios and easily takes down Hydron, prompting Zenoheld to enter battle. Despite their power together, Zenoheld overpowers them with a last resort power transfer and takes the Pyrus attribute energy, making the BT system fully operational. Unfortunately, Farbros is completely destroyed in the process. With the BT System fully active, the fate of New Vestroia's residents is grim.

Many Bakugan are sent to Marucho's house on Earth including the Resistance's. However, Drago decides to remain behind to ensure that everyone has been rescued, remarking how many lives have been lost to protect New Vestroia such as Nobilion, Wavern dying, and also the six Ancient Warriors surrending their powers to six normal bakugan. Helios chases after Drago, refusing to allow Drago throw away his life while Helios still has a score to settle with Drago. Drago and Helios agree to destroy the BT System themselves. However, their powers are not enough. So, in a last attempt, Drago lifts the BT System from the ground and lifts it up to the atmosphere. Just as the BT System detonates, Drago hears Wavern's voice telling him to not give up and that he cannot die yet. Drago, given new determination, absorbs the attribute energies from the BT System and evolves while easily destroying the BT System. He returns to New Vestroia, greeted happily by everyone excluding Spectra and Helios. Mira questions Spectra on their terms of partnership, but Spectra declares he works alone. Spectra returns to his ship and leaves, but not before Helios declares his continuing rivalry with Drago.

Baron, Mira and Ace decided to stay on Earth to train and head to Dan's house for dinner. However, Marucho calls them saying that a strange ghost data has appeared in Bakugan Interspace in the form of unknown Bakugan, which is later known to be digital clones of Neathian Bakugan. Everyone heads into Bakugan Interspace and meet four Bakugan that even Drago doesn't recognize! The Bakugan do not communicate, so Baron suggests battling with them. Marucho creates a digital copy of Baron so his challenger, Haos Aranaut, has a partner brawler. The battle does not go so well for Baron, and things get even worse when Aranaut uses Battlegear, the same thing which Helios had! Aranaut defeats Baron and Nemus and destroys the field of Bakugan Interspace. Everyone begins suspecting that Spectra may have sent the phantom data.

Then, Spectra and Helios telepathically contact Dan and Drago to challenge them to one final match to prove they are the best Bakugan team. Drago uses his new powers to locate Spectra and teleport them to his location. The match begins and Drago appears to have the upper hand, that is until Helios whips out his Twin Destructor Battle Gear, which gives Drago a hard time. In their final fight, Drago calls on the power of his friends and defeats Helios. Spectra and Helios admit defeat and admit that Dan and Drago are the best brawlers. Drago didn't care about being number 1. Spectra decides to take off his mask and &quot;work with the best rather than against him.&quot; Spectra becomes Keith again and Mira hugs him out of joy, happy to have her brother back.

Due to failure, King Zenoheld abuses his son then Mylene tries to stand up for him. However, King Zenoheld rejects her until Hydron places the blame on Professor Clay. King Zenoheld agrees to pit the blame on Mira's dad. Professor Clay discovers the secrets of the DNA code as well as where the transmission originated from (from Neathia). Meanwhile, Marucho analyzes the same data, as well as the one Keith received anonymously and discovers they are identical. Keith then suggests to construct Battle Gear for Drago. Drago denies at first, feeling it would be wrong being part machine but Keith assures him that the Battle Gear will be constructed from Drago's own DNA. This along with the lasting Vexos threat, Drago agrees, but must undergo a battle to test the virtual prototype. They enter Bakugan Interspace and Keith volunteers to use Ventus Hawktor and Subterra Coredem to battle Dan and Drago as Spectra! When Dan equips the gear, Drago struggles with it as his body is rejecting the Battle Gear. However, Drago continues to push forward and wins the battle, but nearly passes out due to the amount of power needed to control JetKor. Fortunately, enough data was gathered to construct Battle Gear that would not harm Drago's body. Shun and the other brawlers hope that Keith finishes Drago's battle gear before King Zenoheld and the Vexos do. The episode ends with Professor Clay telling King Zenoheld he has begin making the ultimate weapon against the brawlers and King Zenoheld agrees with his research.

Mira admits that she wishes their father would come around like Keith did so they could be a family. Keith doubts he will but offers Mira Gus' robotic bee to contact him. She does so and asks him to change sides, but Dr. Clay angrily refuses. Meanwhile, King Zenoheld changes his plan to destroy any living thing that stands in his way. Volt finds this plan goes too far and leaves the Vexos to return home while Mylene wishes him luck. However, his home is no longer what it used to be. Volt meets some children who still see him as their hero despite the things he did as a member of the Vexos and even promises to teach them how to brawl. As the children leave, Prince Hydron appears and a battle quickly follows and Volt easily takes the victory. Hydron is furious and throws a grenade that opens a dimensional hole beneath Volt, sending him into a far dimension (possibly the Doom Dimension). As Volt sinks into the portal, he vows that Hydron will get what's coming to him for all the suffering he has caused innocent people. While JetKor has successfully been completed, King Zenoheld is glad to hear that Volt has been taken care of, he warns the others that they will suffer the same fate if they cross him.

Lync remembers how nice Alice was to him and worries that she may be one of the casualties, so he copies the data for the Alternative System and heads to Moscow to give it to Alice. At first he hesitates, fearing that she may still be mad at him, but before he can make another move, Hydron appears and vows to destroy Lync. During the battle, Hydron implies that he wishes to leave the Vexos as well since he is mad that Lync has a choice to leave whereas he does not. Despite putting up a good fight, Lync is defeated and suffers the same fate as Volt. Before being completely dragged into the warp hole, Lync throws his glove with the chip inside in hopes that Alice will find it. After finishing cooking, Alice heads to find her grandfather and sees the results of Lync's battle with Hydron as well and finds his glove with the memory card. Alice gives the chip to her grandfather who insists they must show it to Dan and the others. When Keith asks how Alice found, she replied that Lync must have left it for her, but sadly adds that he may not be alive. Though the data suggests the Vexos Alternative System is incomplete, Keith states they will require the Bakugan DNA and Battle Gear data that they currently have, making them target for the Vexos once more.

Having followed Billy to Marucho's house in episode 37, Mylene and Shadow have prior knowledge to their hiding place. Once they arrive, they are ambushed by the Resistance, but Mylene takes Mira hostage! Keith quickly agrees to give them the data in exchange for Mira but instead he leads them to Bakugan Interspace. Despite Mira's attempts to change Mylene and Shadow's mind, a battle quickly follows between the four. Shadow is quickly and effortlessly defeated by Keith and MAC Spyder is destroyed in the process. Mira soon defeats Mylene and destroys Macubass. Keith offers Myelene a place in the Resistance but she bitterly rejects and throws one of Hydron's grenades. However, it results in a portal opening in Bakugan Interspace causing it to collapse, which means if it continues further causing the Interspace to shut down with the four of them still inside, they could be trapped there forever!

Before she can change her mind, she and Shadow fall into the Death Ball's portal while Mira and Keith are extracted from Bakugan Interspace safely. Meanwhile, King Zenoheld learns of Mylene and Shadow's fall and blames their lose, as well as the Resistance obtaining the Alternative data, on his son Prince Hydron who he has tortured as a result. Later that night, Hydron has a dream in which Volt and Lync appear to him and tell him to take down his father and take the throne for himself. Though frightened by the dream, it motivates him to fight against his father. Meanwhile, Zenoheld's bakugan Farbros has been repaired and synchronized with the Alternative System. Hearing this, Hydron challenges his father and Prof. Clay transports them to the arena. Though Hydron quickly gains the upper hand, he is no match for Zenoheld's Assail Farbos. He loses and Zenoheld admits that they were never meant to be father and son and has Hydron imprisoned. While in his cell, Volt and Lync reappear telling him to overthrow Zenoheld. Hydron shouts he will defeat his father, while Gus Grav, presumed to have been killed in episode 39, listens from another cell.

Meanwhile, Runo, Julie and Mira prepare a cake for Keith to officially celebrate his joining the Resistance. However, Keith's mind lingers elsewhere, something that Mira notices but Keith brushes off. Dan suggests that instead of waiting for Zenoheld's attack, they storm the palace. Keith, however, is too impatient and takes his ship to the Vest Palace on his own. A battle quickly ensues and Gus feels Spectra needs his help, so he tricks Hydron into battling so their bakugan can free them from their cells and Gus leaves to help Spectra while Hydron is left on his own. When Zenoheld nearly defeats Spectra, Gus arrives in the nick of time, shocking Spectra who is happy finding out that Gus had survived. The two then battle together, giving them the upper hand against Zenoheld. Partway through the battle, Prof. Clay informs Zenoheld that the Alternative System, a giant airship modeled after Farbros, is complete and targets Spectra and Helios for a test fire. The blast sends Spectra's ship flying and takes a huge chunk out of a small planetoid, with Spectra and Gus just barely escaping the impact. Farbros links with the Alternative System and King Zenoheld declares his quest for intergalactic domination to begin.

Luckily Alice and Dr. Michael arrive and use the teleportation signature left behind by Shadow and Mylene to back track to the palace. Meanwhile, Zenoheld continues his attack, forcing Spectra and Gus to retreat and come up with a plan of counter attack. The Resistance are saddened to hear that Tigrerra and Gorem do not wish to participate on the assault of the palace due to the fact that they know their limitations (which are lower than the rest of the team) and it would irresponsibly put Runo and Julie in danger. All of a sudden, Dr. Michael locks onto the palace's coordinates and the Resistance - minus Runo, Julie and Alice - head for the battle and arrive just in time to see Helios and Vulcan in trouble. However, the Alternative is far more powerful than any of them could have ever imagined (because despite the amount of damage they did, which was a pretty decent amount, the Alternative still repaired itself with Farbros). Keith realizes that because Prof. Clay built the Alternative, that he must be inside and asks Mira if she wants to confront him, which she does. Then, Keith uses a new battle gear, the Zukanator, on Helios, in hopes that it will even out the playing field. Keith blows a hole in the Alternative and he and Mira enter the machine.

Meanwhile, Prof. Clay receives a video transmisson from a faraway world just as Mira and Keith arrive to make one final appeal. Once the brawlers realize Mira and Keith are missing, they deduce that the siblings may have found a way inside, so Dan uses Jetkor to blast a hole in the Alternative while Gus and Marucho stay behind to guard the rear. Gus and Vulcan are nearly beaten when Hydron steps in and saves him. Shun, having suggested to find the Power Reactor of the Alternative AND having memorized the blueprints of the machine, leads the Resistance through the Alternative. However, they are all quickly caught in a trap against four mysterious bakugan, unrecognized by Drago. While Mira pleads with her father to abandon his evil plans with Zenoheld, Dan and the others destroy the four unknown Bakugan as well as the Power Reactor. As they make their escape, Prof. Clay saves Mira from falling debris, but is trapped on the ship and Hydron captures his father, forcing them both to &quot;go down with the ship.&quot; Prof. Clay returns to this computer and finds that the video he received depicts Bakugan in war. The Resistance go their separate ways as Keith and Gus thank Dan for showing them the error of their ways. 3 weeks later, Marucho has completely repaired Bakugan Interspace and uses Akwimos to test it while Shun uses Hawktor and Dan sticks with Drago. Then, they are approached by a boy named Ren who asks them if they're the Brawlers.

          </div>
          <div class="plot">On the distant planet Gundalia, the Twelve Orders discuss the explosion caused by Ren and Dan's battle in Bakugan Interspace. Kazarina, the head of the Bakugan Biology Research lab, is unable to identify the strong powerful Bakugan that caused the explosion. So, Emperor Barodius orders that this bakugan be brought to them before it joins their enemy. Back on Earth, Jake and Julie still believe that what Dan saw was a dream, though he is still convinced that it was real. Just then, Marucho calls and everyone heads to Bakugan Interspace, where Ren confesses that he is a humanoid alien being from Gundalia looking for strong battlers to help fend of the invading Neathians. Though hesitant, the Brawlers accept and track down two moles identified by Ren, Sid Arcale and Lena Isis and a battle ensues. Though Sid and Lena gain the upperhand, Dan pulls through with Jetkor and wins the battle. Everyone congratulates Dan on the victory. However, there may be more to Ren than meets the eye.

          <div class="plot">As Ren identifies three more Neathian moles (Mason Brown, Jesse Glenn, and Zenet Surrow), Princess Fabia from Neathia arrives in Bakugan Interspace looking for the recipients of the message she sent. Dan, having slept in, rushes to Bakugan Interspace and runs into Fabia, literally. Fabia learns that he is the top brawler in Bakugan Interspace, but before she can ask about her message, Dan rushes off to meet his friends. He tells them about the girl and Ren suspects she may be a Neathian spy. Before they can track her, Fabia arrives and is shocked to find that Ren, a Gundalian has gained their trust first! Now that Dan has sided with the Gundalians, Fabia claims they are her enemy and a battle ensues between her and Dan. Dan quickly takes the lead but falters when Fabia summons Haos Aranaut, the original Aranaut from which the clone Aranaut, Coredom, Hawktor and Akwimos originated, meaning Fabia sent the Phantom Data. This also means that it came from their enemies, the Neathians, something that Shun is not so sure of anymore. Defeated, Fabia leaves and wonders what to do now that Dan has sided with the Gundalians. While the others congratulate Dan on his victory, Shun disappears to ask Fabia what her side of the story is.

When another mole, Mason Brown, is located, Dan challenges him to a battle, but Jake steps in and wants to prove himself. Due to his inexperience, Jake quickly loses and feels he has failed Dan in proving himself. The next day, Jake is still upset over his loss, so Julie, being a Subterra master, offers to help him discover his own battling style. Jake returns for a rematch with Mason while being greeted by a bitter crowd. With his newfound confidence, Jake easily defeats Mason. Before the Brawlers can pursue Mason, he teleports out of the stadium. Dan congratulates Jake, who becomes an official Battle Brawler.

The puzzling part is that each brawler is eventually returned to BI. Meanwhile, Sid and Zenet find their recruiting hard when Marucho puts out an announcement to everyone not to battle Sid, Lena, Mason, Jesse and Zenet. In retaliation, Sid and Zenet challenge Dan and Ren to a battle. Ren is quickly taken out, leaving Dan to fend for himself. Being outnumbered, Dan loses but Sid allows him to keep Drago. After the battle, Gill of the Twelve Orders orders Sid to not engage the brawlers and to leave it to Ren, who states their plan is working perfectly.

While Marucho and Ren work hard on an expansion for Bakugan Interspace Jesse Glenn arrives. Dan heads to the new arena to challenge him but is stopped by Fabia, who claims that Jesse is not who he claims to be. Fabia steps in to fight Jesse, something that greatly confuses Dan and the others since they all think that both Jessie and Fabia are Neathians. Ren insists that they do not cheer for either of them and they should just let their enemies destroy each other. Despite this, Dan, Jake and Marucho cheer for Fabia. Although she puts up a good fight, Fabia loses due to a bug in the field, causing her to cry over her loss. Shun explains that the only person who could plant an unlikely bug that caused Fabia's defeat was someone familiar with the BI System, someone like Ren. Ren denies everything while Jesse flees. Fabia and Shun expose Ren for lying about how Neathia attacked Gundalia, causing him to run away. Marucho, however, refuses to believe these accusations and rushed off to find Ren.

Meanwhile, Fabia tells everyone her side of the story. Neathia was attacked by Gundalia and, due to their bakugan's inexperience in battle, they quickly lost to the Gundalian Bakugan. Fabia then sent out a distress message via the Phantom Data which lead her to BI on Earth. Shun discovers the battle going on between Marucho and Ren. When they arrive, Marucho defeats Ren. Ren attempts to get Marucho to switch sides, but he refuses to leave his friends. Ren declares their friendship over and reveals his true Gundalian form and tells Marucho that the next time they meet, they will be enemies.

Fabia worries that Dan and the others do not fully trust her as they were easily tricked by Ren. Dan assures her that they completely trust her after seeing how angry she got about Bakugan being used for war. Relieved, Fabia gives Shun, Marucho and Jake the real Hawktor, Akwimos and Coredem. Meanwhile, Ren leads the other Gundalians to kidnapped two brawlers named Taylor and Casey. The two are taken back to Gundalia where they are brainwashed into fighting against the Neathians. Dan and the others confront Ren who sends Taylor and Casey to attack them. Dan and Shun battle Mason and Taylor while Marucho and Jake battle Sid and Casey. Fabia, however, sneaks off in hopes for finding Ren to discover his plans. After winning their respective battles and freeing Taylor and Casey from the Gundalians' control, they are all forced out of BI. Ren reveals that he is now in sole control of BI.

However it seems that they were the only ones kicked out as other kids continue to log on, not knowing what is going on. To make things easier, Marucho, Shun and Fabia head over to Dan in Bayview City aboard his giant airship. Dan tries to enter Bakugan Interspace, but is rejected. He tries to tell the other kids about the danger, but none of them believe him. Marucho is unable to shut it down as Ren has complete control, so Jake tries brute force, which actually works. Marucho takes them to a remote access room so they can plan their next move. Fabia remembers that the Neathian Bakugan can body shift themselves into Interspace. Dan immediately wants to go, but Drago reminds him he does not have that same power. So Jake volunteers and brings Dan along using Coredem's power. Dan and Jake witness brainwashed kids take back more kids back to Gundalia. The same two brawlers who accused Dan of lying reappear, now brainwashed by Gundalia, and battle Dan and Jake. They easily secure victory as well as the opponent Bakugan. The two boys are released from Gundalian control and Dan and Jake take them out of Bakugan Interspace. Dan vows to rescue all the brainwashed children.

Emperor Barodius calls Ren and suspects Ren may betray them due to his desire to not battle with his former friends. Ren assures him of his loyalty while Linehalt attempts to get the truth from his friend. Ren reminds him of the story behind their loyalty to Barodius: there were many ancient Bakugan with Forbidden powers but they were sealed underground. Eventually their numbers dwindled to just Linehalt. Ren was the last descendant of the Protectors of the Dark Bakugan and was assigned to take care of Linehalt. Over the years, they bonded and dreamed of escaping their underground prison until Barodius recruited them to lead the invasion team to Earth. Meanwhile, Marucho and Fabia infiltrate Bakugan Interspace. Marucho tries to regain control while Fabia and an Avatar Marucho battle Lena and Zenet. The Avatar is quickly taken out as Ren discovers Marucho's invasion. Fabia is defeated and Zenet and Lena decided to take her back as a prisoner, something that will give them an edge against Neathia. However, Marucho arrives in time to get her out. Though their mission was unsuccessful, Marucho reveals he installed a back door to better access Bakugan Interspace without alerting Ren and his team.

In a last desperate attempt, the Captain of the Neathian Guard sends a Castle Knight, Linus to Earth to give Fabia the Element, the very thing the Gundalians are trying to take from the Neathians. As security tightens for the brawlers, their attempt to bring kids out safely is getting more difficult. However, many of the kids believe Dan and the brawlers over their wanted announcement. After Shun returns from saving more kids, he runs into Linus who is looking for Fabia. Though reluctant to trust him at first, they are attacked by Ren and Jesse and a battle ensues. Linus' partner Neo displays incredible power but the battle eventually goes to Jesse, who takes Neo as his victory prize. Linus is taken back to the others after being injured during the battle. He tells Fabia that having lost Neo to the Gundalians, he has also lost the Element, leaving Neathia doomed.

With Drago evolving once again, Dan easily takes a win. Meanwhile, Neo appears to Linus in his dream to bid his friend a final farewell, his mission now complete. Julie comes into the room to find Linus crying over the loss of his best friend. Ren and Sid are berated for having lost the Element so soon after getting it. Sid's Rubanoid is taken by Kazarina for experiments while Sid is disposed of.

Meanwhile, Barodious scolds Ren, Lena, Zenet, Mason and Jesse for seriously failing their initial plan to gain the Brawlers' trust and violenty commands the Twelve Orders to attack Neathia. The Brawlers do their best to hold the Gundalians off while Dan and Drago fight Barodius and Dharak Colossus but they succeed in breaking through Neathia's second shield.

Unfortunately for her, Kazarina is well prepared Phosphos is taken out by Lumagrowl while Kazarina disposes of Lena. Kazarina successfully blames Lena for the failure and speaks to Gill about how Lena somehow knew of her plan, suggesting that she knew Gill had tipped her off.

Kazarina and Stoica prepare to punish Jesse for his escape and lose to the brawlers while Ren attempts to spare Jesse by saying he was much a part of the battle as Jesse was. Kazarina, however, tells him that he can share that information with Barodius himself. Plitheon suddenly speaks out and begs to be separated from Jesse, declaring that he can't stand him, something that surprises Jesse. However, Lumagrowl and Lytherius attack Plitheon for turning on his master. Jesse forgives Plitheon, saying that co-stars often have friction between them, but Plitheon insists he means what he said, as he slowly fades away. Jesse remarks that the spotlight is on Ren now and is presumed killed, leaving behind the book he always carries. While Kazarina and Stoica are walking through the hall, Nurzak appears and tells them that although they can trick the others of their true intentions, he can see them for what they really are.

            3x19 - The Secret of the Orb
          </div>
          <div class="plot">With the second shield functioning at an even more powerful rate than before, things are looking good for Neathia. Meanwhile, Nurzak and Kazarina are sent to do recon. Nurzak tells Sabator how Barodius' father, the previous Emperor, did not seek to attain the Sacred Orb, fearing that its power is too great, while Barodius is far too ambitious and down right stupid for engaging in such a quest. Mason, however, has plans of his own and escapes the ship, possibly to switch sides. Kazarina becomes infuriated because of what may happen to her, but Nurzak assures her that he and Ren will find Mason. While on their search, they run into Fabia and Marucho, who still feels bitter about Ren's betrayal. Marucho's emotions only become worse when Ren says that their entire friendship was just a ploy and that Marucho shouldn't let something so stupid affect him so. The battle becomes so intense that the Sacred Orb shoots out dimensional rays, that should one get caught in, they will be sent around the dimensions without any way back. Nurzak and Ren retreat while Aranaut and Akwimos attempt to shield Fabia and Marucho from the dimensional rays. Just before it hits them, the Sacred Orb stops but not before Mason and Avior fall victim to it. Back at the palace, Serena expresses how happy she is that Fabia and Marucho made it back all right, while everyone questions why the Sacred Orb acted so. Meanwhile, Marucho believes that Ren will return to their side. However, things don't look to good for Kazarina as she finally gets the punishment she deserves from Barodius, though she is kept alive. While in the hallway, she encounters Nurzak who tells her that he is leaving the Emperor and with Gill as the Emperor's right hand, she needs to find a place for herself quickly. He encourages her to join him, to which she agrees.

            3x20 - Partners 'Til the End
          </div>
          <div class="plot">The brawlers decide to use the Sacred Orb to their advantage by convincing Gundalians who fear it's power to switch sides, namely Nurzak. Ren has a meeting with Barodius where the Emperor reveals that despite the failures of Ren's team, he keeps Ren around because of his potential. Later in the hallway, Linehalt asks Ren what is wrong, to which he replies the only reason they serve and obey the Emperor is because he was allowed out of the darkness he and Linehalt had lived in. Suddenly, Zenet comes in and begs Ren to help her, fearing that she will suffer the same fate as the others. Ren brushes her off and tells her she has nothing to worry about. However, she is not convinced. Contestir tries to cheer her up by agreeing with Ren, but Zenet tells him that Gundalians care nothing of loyalty and despite her morphing abilities she has no use to them. Then she overhears that Gill and Ren are leaving to Neathia to destroy the second shield again. She disguises herself as Ren to take his place in order to prove herself, but Krakix easily sees through the guise and Gill decides to give her a chance anyway. While Gill and Krakix gather data on the second shield to completely destroy it, Zenet must keep Shun and Hawktor off him. However, Shun proves to be too much for her to handle, so Gill steps in and nearly defeats Shun, that is until Dan and Drago arrive. Gill and Zenet are defeated and return to Gundalia, where Zenet greatly fears her punishment. However, Contestir convinces Gill that because he is Barodius' right hand man, he will likely have people plotting against him, and that he may have use for a spy and volunteers Zenet. Gill sees this as a good idea and sends her to spy on Kazarina as Nurzak. She pulls it off and returns with information that Kazarina and Nurzak and plotting to overthrow the Emperor. Despite a job well done, Gill and Krakix kill Zenet and Contestir. Zenet once again explains Contestir that Gundalians care nothing for loyalty. Contestir argues that he has always been loyal to Zenet. She begins crying and apologizes for not seeing it earlier.

          <div class="plot">Nurzak sends a message to the brawlers for a meeting to discuss a peace treaty. The brawlers are unsure but decide to take the risk anyway. Nurzak plans to use Kazarina's attack on the emperor as his chance to sneak away to Neathia and give the brawlers the Switch Code, something that can supposedly control the Sacred Orb. Meanwhile, Gill informs Barodius of Nurzak and Kazarin'a betrayal and heads to stop him before he leaves for Neathia. Kazarina arrives with her troops and reveals that she is actually working for Barodius as a triple agent! However, Barodius decides to deal with Nurzak via battle. When Sabotaur begins absorbing Dharak's power, it proves to be too much for him to handle. Barodius destroys Nuzak and Sabotaur and the entire building as well. The brawlers, still waiting for Nurzak, conclude that they have either been stood up or something has happened to Nurzak. Back on Gundalia, Barodius thanks Kazarina for her services while Gill vows to take Kazarina down, still not trusting her.

          <div class="plot">With one of the 12 Orders disposed of, Barodius secures the loyalty of the others or else they will face the same fate as Nurzak. 2-3 days are required before Dharak's Exokor is ready, so Dharak suggests that, in the meantime, they launch a smaller attack to distract the Neathians. Once again, the Gundalians rely on the kidnapped humans from Bakugan Interspace to do their fighting for them. Unfortunately for the brawlers, when most of the kids are beaten, the Gundalian brainwashing does not wear off. While Kazarina experiments on more bakugan, she sends Ren to collect more battlers from Bakugan Interspace while Gill sends Stoica with him. Stoica however, bails to do things his way leaving Ren on his own, while Linehalt suggest they rethink their loyalties to which Ren tells him they have come too far to switch sides. Meanwhile, the subterra brawler Fabia defeated in episode 3, Koji, attempts to get in to have a battle, but is stopped by Julie, who tells him about the Gundalian-Neathian war while Stoica watches from afar. Koji leaves, believing Julie's story is too farfetched, and Stoica convinces him to head to Gundalia where he and other kids are brainwashed by Kazarina. With more kids attacking, Dan and Fabia split off from the others and encounter a Bakugan Mobile Assault Vehicle, a highly evolved Battle Gear, named Implanton. Fabia immediately recognizes Koji but is unable to get him to remember her. Fabia decides to use an Assault Vehicle designed for Drago and has it uploaded to his Bakumeter, and while it is downloading, she holds off Koji. The upload is complete and Dan easily defeats Koji with the Drago's Assult Vehicle, but Koji is still under their influence. Dan vows to free all the kids from Gundalian control. Kazarina releases control and the kids are returned to Bakugan Interspace. Koji tells Julie about what happened and how he doesn't remember anything after meeting Stoica but he vaguely remembers Dan's voice.

          <div class="plot">Deep within Gundalia, Sid wakes up from statis and learns that he, Lena, Jesse and Zenet were not actually killed, but imprisoned. Barodius order the attack to commence at dawn while Kazarina continues with her experiments. Sid has managed to escape and notices Ren leaving with some troops. On Neathia, the brawlers stand watch, waiting for the Gundalian forces, which arrives at sunrise. Armed with a Bakugan Mobile Assault Vehicle, Drago quickly tears through the Gundalian forces. Drago is suddenly ambushed by Ren and Linehalt but the two are too evenly matched. Dan begins asking why Ren fights for Barodius to which Ren reveals Barodius gave him freedom. Dan mentions that the emperor put him in darkness and that Ren must have been happy being friends with Marucho, and even though it was a ruse, Dan knows he'd rather be fighting with them rather than against them. Ren shouts at Dan saying that he is Gundalian and he knows nothing, but Dan replies that he is also a Brawler. Dan tries to get Ren to join them, but Ren refuses to forget those who have fallen at his hands (Sid, Lena, Jesse and Zenet). The fight continues but Rubanoid suddenly enters, being commanded by Sid. The two press hard on Dan and Drago but Dan reveals another new Assault Vehicle, one which he can control and Dan easily wins the battle. Sid tells Ren that the others are still alive and Dharak attacks them. Sid knocks Ren out of the way and falls over a cliff, but not before giving Rubanoid to Ren to take care of and telling him to not worry about the others and to &quot;do what he has to do.&quot; Dan begs Ren not to go, but he leaves without a word.

          <div class="plot">After his battle with Dan and Sid giving him Rubanoid, Ren is very confused as to what he should do. The invasion continues on as the brawlers continue to push back the Gundalians. Kazarina finishes her experiments on Dharak's Exokor while Ren visits Barodius. Ren asks why he has been spared while the others have been punished and assumes it has to do with Linehalt's &quot;forbidden powers.&quot; Barodius promises Ren he will have everything he wants so long as he completes his missions. Kazarina informs the emperor of Exokor's completion and the 12 Orders clear a path to the second shield for him. The others hold off the rest of the 12 Orders but have trouble dealing with them. Meanwhile, Drago and Dan hammer on Colossus Dharak, but he proves to be far too powerful. Once again, Dan reaches out to Ren to get him to switch sides before continuing battling Barodius. Drago quickly falls to Dharak's immense power and the second shield is punctured. Barodius orders Ren to prove his loyalty by finishing off Dan and Drago. Linehalt asks if Ren is sure to which he replies he has no other choice. Dan tells Ren just to get it over with when Ren suddenly fires at Dharak and declares he is doing something he should have done a long time ago: fighting alongside his real friends.

Dharak however, chooses to let Exokor, Riptor, and Smashtor do the fighting, but eventually joins in a one on one battle against Linehalt. Meanwhile, one by one, the brawlers are taken out by the Twelve Orders (Although Shun managed to take out Kazarina before falling to Airzel). Ren takes a bad beating, so Dan decides to step in, but Linehalt and Ren ask him to stay out of the fight. Meanwhile, Queen Serena prays to the Sacred Orb to protect the brawlers from harm. Barodius begins taunting Ren, and Linehalt begins exhibiting his Forbidden Powers, to the points where they begin to tear Neathia apart. The Sacred Orb, in response to Linehalt's power, sends out its last defense: Dragonoid Colossus. Dragonoid Colossus arrives in time and subdues Linehalt before entering Dan's BakuMeter. Ren realizes that he must live in seclusion to avoid Linehalt's power from causing harm and begins to leave, but is stopped by the brawlers. They welcome him back into their group insisting that Linehalt's power could do a lot of good as it could harm, Ren, feeling happy to be accepted back to the group, transforms into his human form. Fabia, however, is not so sure about their new teammate.

Elright explains that, as a last resort, the third shield is programmed to expel anyone with Gundalian DNA. Dan asks if they can just shut the shield off to let Ren in, but Fabia refuses and leaves. Serena explains the origins of her hatred to the Gundalians: Aranaut was originally partnered with Commander Jin, but they were defeated by Kazarina. Jin was unfortunately lost in battle and Aranaut was taken captive and experimented on. Fabia single handedly infiltrated the Gundalian palace and rescued Aranaut. Serena then reveals that Jin was Fabia's fiance and that Aranaut has no memories prior to his rescue due to the experiments. While Marucho searches for Ren, Dan asks Fabia to give Ren a chance. So, everyone heads to to find Ren and Marucho as Fabia challenges Ren to a battle. The stakes: if Ren wins, he can stay, but if he loses, he must leave Neathia forever. Ren puts in Linehalt and Rubanoid but they both fall to Aranaut. Knowing the conditions of his defeat, Ren begins crying. However, Fabia is convinced that he has changed and welcomes him to the brawlers. Ren is made a Castle Knight by Queen Serena and swears loyalty to her and the brawlers.

When they find that the third shield contains a DNA barrier, they retreat back to Gundalia for a new strategy. Meanwhile, the Neathians send out patrols to watch out for any Gundalians attacking while a geometric storm (something that disrupts their radars) is taking place, with the Brawlers divided into groups of two to help the patrols. Dan and Jake are in one group, and they soon find an Earth boy named Robin who claims to have escaped the Gundalians' clutches and wants to find his sister. Jake wants to help him, but Dan tries to hold him back, as it is too dangerous, fearing that it may be a trick by the Gundalians. Jake then decides to look for Robin himself, but it turns out to be a trap, as Robin was brainwashed by the Gundalians all along. Kazarina appears and challenges Jake to a battle. Jake doesn't back down and is determined to free the brainwashed children from the Gundalians. Meanwhile, Dan reports back what had happened and the others scolded him for letting Jake go out on his own, so they all go out to look for him. Kazarina lays it hard on Jake and proves to be to much for the inexperienced brawler to handle. Jake scolds Kazarina for using other people to do her dirty work, to which she replies all the children are safe back on Earth, having outgrown their usefulness as strong battlers and she now uses them to bring in stronger subjects...like Jake. The rest of the Brawlers arrive just as Jake is defeated. He apologizes for not having listened to Dan and is taken by Kazarina.

Meanwhile, Dan eagerly wants to rescue him, feeling that their argument was his fault but everyone tries to talk him out of it. Just then Jake suddenly walks right back into Neathia, claiming to have escaped, however, Shun is not easily convinced of this. When Jake wakes up from his rest, Shun tests his theory by asking Jake if he remembers fighting to restart the second shield, however Jake remembers that he and Marucho were on decoy duty. Dan beings suspecting that something must be wrong with Jake when he begins suggesting making changes to the third shield. Later that night, Jake heads to tamper with the shield controller and get teleported to Dan, who had set the trap with Captain Elright earlier. Jake finally reveals he and Coredem have been brainwashed by Kazarina and a battle ensues. The battle proves to be too much for Dan to handle due to the new and powerful ability card Kazarina had entrusted Jake with. Just then, Shun steps in and they take out Coredem, however Jake does not return to normal and is taken back by Kazarina. Dan vows to rescue his friend.

Linus arrives to bring them all lunch, when Dan and Drago are suddenly pulled away by Dragnoid Colossus to a place between dimensions. There he meets Nurzak and Mason. Dragonoid Colossus explains that if Dan wants to leave, he must defeat him in battle and a battle ensues, Dragonoid Colossus easily gaining the upper hand. As the battle goes on, Nurzak explains that the Sacred Orb is the origin of all Bakugan and that Dragnoid Colossus has been tasked with protecting it. Only two are able to defeat him, the dragon of fire and of darkness: Dragonoid and Dharaknoid and if Drago loses, they will just be giving Dharak the chance to take the Sacred Orb. Dan and Drago manage to pull through and defeat Dragnoid Colossus. Dragonoid Colossus takes Dan and Drago and tells them the rest of the story of the Sacred Orb: the first two bakugan born from the Sacred Orb were Dragonoid and Dharaknoid and every bakugan was born from their DNA sequence. Drago accepts his responsibility and evolves into Blitz Drago. They return to Neathia, bringing along Nurzak and Mason, who decide to fight against Gundalia, although Fabia warns that she will be watching them. Riding Dragonoid Colossus, they head to Gundalia to rescue Jake.

However, Dragonoid Colossus informs Dan that Drago and Dharak are too evenly matched and that Drago must win at all costs. Despite another evolution, it seems as though Drago barely matches up to Dharak in terms of power. Meanwhile, Nurzak suggests they split up again, himself with Fabia and Ren with Mason, in hopes of surprising Kazarina, having already lost the element of surprise earlier. Dragonoid Colossus explains that despite changing in appearance and gaining new powers, Drago has yet to reach his true evolution. Drago begins to worry that he is not worthy of protecting the Sacred Orb, but Dan assures him that they have defeated evil many times before because they believed in themselves. With Drago's confidence restored, a brand new ability is unlocked, which Drago uses to win the battle. Dan demands to have Jake returned and Barodius complies, but Jake is still under the influence of Gundalian hypnosis and attacks Dan, knocking him out in the process. Meanwhile, Nurzak and Fabia get close to Kazarina's lab where she and Stoica confront them.

However, once they reach the lab, they are nowhere to be seen. Kazarina and Stoica press on the attack, causing Fabia and Nurzak to fall down a cliff. However that was part of their plan. Nurzak tells Fabia a story of a man who thrived to fight so much that he led a group of soldiers, including his daughter, into a battle they were unprepared for, resulting in the girl's death. Nurzak laments that Fabia reminds him of her. Suddenly, Kazarina and Stoica discover they have survived and another battle ensues. Meanwhile, Shun and Marucho have snuck into the palace under the guise of guards while Kazarina reveals a surprise: a hypnotized Lena, Jesse and Zenet.

Drago struggles against Dharak, and is knocked out and reverts to a primal state, relying solely on instinct, but Dan manages to snap him out of it. Meanwhile, everyone awakens after being defeated by Dharak and Linehalt is upset at the devastation so he uses his Forbidden Power to restore the war torn Neathia. Drago eventually manages to defeat Dharak and they are all returned to Neathia. However, Barodius decides to take the Sacred Orb's power for himself but its power is too much for Dharak to take in and they are destroyed. Code Eve awards Drago the Sacred Orb's power and he evolves into Titanium Dragonoid. With the war finally over, Nurzak, Ren, and the rest of his team create a formal alliance with the Neathians leave to form a new government on Gundalia. Dan, Drago, Marucho, Shun, and Jake return to Earth, and say goodbye to the Neathians as well as Akwimos, Hawktor, and Coredem (who must stay on Neathia). The four Brawlers return to Earth and are greeted by Julie and Dan's mom. Later, they return to Bakugan Interspace, where everything has returned to normal and Dan ends up battling Koji.

Marucho has teamed up with a Bakugan from Gundalia, Tristar, while Shun's partner is Taylean, a Bakugan from Neathia. After winning a battle, Dan and Drago learn that there have been two groups of battlers, Team Sellon and Team Anubias who have risen to high ranks not far behind Dan. Dan has a nightmare the following night in which a mysterious entity demands that Dan give him something. Drago, who also had a vision of a bakugan during the earlier battle, speculates that the two events may be related. Unconcerned by this deadly and skilled competition, Dan challenges Ben, a member of Team Anubias to a brawl. While Dan and Drago initially struggle due to the battle environment and faced against two bakugan. They struggle and just before they are about to lose, the entity again appears to Dan (Drago sees the image of the bakugan) and tells him to release his hidden power and destroy ben and his bakugan, also giving him all the power. They ultimately pull out a win after realeasing that power. However, Drago is unable to control the power nearly destroying the arena. This leaves Dan and Drago to wonder about the dangers of this latest discovery and if they are a threat.

Dan, however, shrugs it off and says he'll get Drago's powers under control, but secretly, he's extremely nervous about the amount of power Drago unleashed, and the two of them decide to go train to get it under control. Meanwhile, Marucho decides to have a battle to make up for Dan having to sit out, so he fights against Jack of Team Anubias. He and Tristar struggle to win against Jack and his Guardian Bakugan, Aquos Krakenoid. Meanwhile, Dan and Drago locate an abandoned arena to use as a training ground, but shortly after, a mysterious Mechtogan that calls himself Zenthon appears and wreaks havoc on the arena. Dan and Drago try to defeat it, but it eventually flies away and reappears to interfere with Marucho and Jack's battle and devastating the arena. Anubias and Sellon team up to fight Zenthon but struggle to defeat it, not even managing to land a hit. Eventually, however, Zenthon flies off and Anubias and Sellon part ways. Marucho and Shun then speculate that, since Zenthon has the same destructive power as Drago, they may be connected. Meanwhile, the masked man, whose named is officially revealed to be Mag Mel, is trying to break free of his prison, but requires more energy from Dan and Drago to do so. One of his hooded servants (who looks a lot like Sellon) informs him of the Mechtogan attack. He is astounded that Drago has that sort of power and tries to absorb more energy from his Darkas Dragonoid (or possibly Dragon and Dan) and begins to break free.

Shun and Marucho tell Dan that they still think he should not fight, but will support him anyway. Dan thanks them and promises to reveal everything after the battle. During the fight, a vision of Mag Mel and Razenoid appear and Dan and Drago think they are fighting them instead of Anubias, causing them to lay waste to the field and endanger the crowd. To make matters worse, Zenthon reappears and everyone learns that Drago created him. Once Zenthon leaves, Dan and Drago's vision are returned to normal. The battle is declared over and Dan is disqualified for illegally using Zenthon (even though it was unintentional) and Anubias is crowned number one of Bakugan Interspace. Unable to face his fans who have turned against him, let alone his friends, Dan packs up his things and leaves.

When they question Dylan, they discover that the upgrade for the BakuNano just appeared out of nowhere. Sellon has another talk with Shun and suggests that he take the position of leader of the Brawlers and put an end to BakuNano use since Dan and Drago are gone. Their conversation is interrupted when Marucho is brutally defeated in battle by the Bash Brothers, two boys using BakuNanos. Shun arrives on the scene and battles the two brothers.

He speaks out to the crowd that as the new leader of the Brawlers, he will abolish the harsh and dangerous style of brawling accidently set off by Dan and Drago.

However, he shows no signs of backing down when he enters a battle royale. Things get tough when up against Robin from Team Anubias and Soon from Team Sellon when Taylean suddenly spawns a Mechtogan, Silent Strike. Shun tries his best to defeat it and is rescued by Rafe and Paige. After Silent Strike flees, Rafe and Paige reveal that they are a Neathian and Gundalian, respectively. They have learned that the Mechtogans are the offspring of chaos when there is a lack of sync between a brawler and their Bakugan and Princess Fabia has sent them to help the Brawlers. Shun, however, refuses the help and leaves while Marucho's father asks him to quit the Brawlers.

Dan and Drago tell them that they should only be fighting them not the innocent but Mag Mel responds as it is an act of revenge and he doesn't care about nobility. On Earth, the drilling has gone to 70% and Spectra and Gus go attack. Shun summons Faser Titan to help while some fear there are too many. Marucho reassures them as Rafe and Paige continue to fight. Mag Mel begins to taunt Dan and he manages to get them to fall down. He tries to get Dreadeon and Razen Titan to kill them but Zenthon and Zenthon Titan defend them. However, the residual energy created from them caused an outburst of energy which not only destroys them but Razenoid absorbs it to become bigger and stronger.

With the drilling up to 85%, the battling continues with more Titans being destroyed. Dan and Drago, however, are not doing as well as Mag Mel tells them about the energy collected from Bakugan Interspace. Noah sees a vision of Anubias inspiring him to fight on and telling him how much he grown. Chris and Soon then hear Sellon's voice and run towards it. Dan and Drago then receive power from the gate and key while Razenoid blasts Drago. When the smoke clears, Titanium Dragonoid isn't there and is replaced by Fusion Dragonoid! Razenoid then tries to aim at Drago but he constantly misses. He fires at Razenoid which manages to destroy him and breaking the gate and key of them. Mag Mel is about to die but not before saying that Dan is still doomed. Mag Mel then disappears. On Earth, all the Chaos Bakugan, Mechtogan, and Mechtogan Titans disappear along with the Dark Moon. Everyone else returned confused as shimmering dust falls from the sky. They then believe that Dan and Drago sacrificed themselves but then in a glowing light, Dan and Drago appear. Everybody is happy and ask him what happened with Dylan walking away with his signature lollipop. They asked how was the battle and Dan responds with it being easy.
