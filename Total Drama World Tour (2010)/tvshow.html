          <div class="plot">The 17 contestants see the plane and all of the accommodations. They then compete in a challenge where they have to navigate around a pyramid to reach the finish line. They can choose to either climb on top of the pyramid, or go under the pyramid (a majority of the cast chose the latter). Duncan quits mainly due to refusing to sing and having to listen to Gwen and Courtney argue the whole way up the pyramid. Three teams are made (names chosen by the teams themselves) according to who finished the challenge first. They are also given a reward. DJ, LeShawna, Harold, Lindsay, and Bridgette are on Team Victory and are given a stick. Owen, Alejandro, Noah, Sierra, and Tyler are on Team Chris is Really Really Really Really Hot, and are given a goat. Courtney, Heather, Izzy, Cody, and Gwen are on Team Amazon and are given a camel. Ezekiel is the last to finish the race, but is not eliminated because of Duncan quitting, so Chris places him on Team Victory.

          <div class="plot">The remaining contestants are forced to compete in a camel race to the Nile, bringing their rewards to the finish line. Chris tells them that each reward has a &quot;special surprise&quot; (the stick being a divining rod, the camel being a camel, and the goat being small). Izzy and Sierra switch teams because of Sierra's interest in Cody and Izzy's interest in Owen. Chris catches Duncan humming the song from the previous episode while lounging in the plane, but Duncan denies it. Alejandro tries to win everybody over with compliments and remarks, but Heather doesn't buy it, though she admits he's a good manipulator. In the second challenge, the contestants must weave a basket and row across The Nile to the finish line. Ezekiel is eliminated due to accidentally feeding the team's reward to a crocodile. Even though he was voted off, he holds onto one of the plane's tail wings, refusing to give up, and hinting a possible return to the game.

          <div class="plot">The contestants figure out they are in Japan after Chef slashes the door open and they fall in a giant bowl of rice. The first challenge was a game of giant pinball with each team having a pinball partner (Teams Victory and CRRRRH got a panda and Team Amazon had Cody and Sierra instead), Team Chris is Really Really Really Really Hot won thanks to Alejandro's care for the panda. The second challenge was writing and producing a Japanese commercial for the brand new Total Drama Yum Yum Happy Go Time Candy Fish Tails. Team CRRRRH chose to do a Japanese monster mash style commercial, Team Victory chose to do a samurai style commercial, and Team Amazon did a commercial with the leftovers. In the end, Team Amazon won because of Chef's love for exploding donuts. Overall, Harold quit because the samurai style was his idea. Instead of being pushed out of the plane, he &quot;kills&quot; himself with a toy lightsaber and falls out.

          </div>
          <div class="plot">The episode opens up with Team Amazon relaxing in the first-class area of the plane. Cody's relaxation is interrupted when Sierra starts rubbing his foot and ends up paralyzing him. In the loser area, LeShawna is playing with the num-yos Harold gave her. Chris walks in, and the contestants begin to complain about Japan. The plane begins to land, terrifying Owen. The plane lands in Yukon. Chris explains that the contestants won't be getting coats, causing them to huddle together for warmth. The first challenge involves team crossing the cassum by jumping from shard to shard. Once at the sleds, the first one there must climb up the mountain while carrying their team on the sled. Team Victory won the first challenge thanks to DJ mysteriously getting there. During the challenge, DJ accidentally got his eyes frozen by crying too much and ended up getting his team lost and hitting a baby seal. Alejandro continues to manipulate the contestants on Team Victory to his pleasure and their elimination, as he starts to flirt with Bridgette, causing her to get distracted. Bridgette starts to kiss Alejandro, but gets tricked and stuck to a pole. Team Chris is Really Really Really Really Hot won thanks to Owen's weight causing a rapid speed which accelerated the sled. In the end, Bridgette got eliminated for kissing a pole and not crossing the finish line with her team. Before being eliminated, she tries to warn her teammates about Alejandro being evil, but gets pushed off the plane.

          <div class="plot">The episode starts off with Team Chris is Really Really Really Really Hot relaxing in the winners cabin. Team Amazon's female members (except for Sierra) complain about the loosers section. Heather tries to manipulate Sierra and Cody into obeying her, which fails to work, as they both know of Heather's villainous personality. Alejandro continues to manipulate Team Victory by smuggling them food and trying to win them over. The contestants figure out their in New York after falling in a boat and landing on water. The first challenge involves the contestants climbing to the top of the Statue of Liberty getting the baby carriges on top of Lady Liberty's crown, then racing down to the boats, and finally driving to Central Park. The contestants figure out the ropes are made of wool when trying to climb them. Alejandro manipulates Sierra into revealing humiliating things about Chris's past, such as him having his own cooking show that got cancelled after one episode, making terrible movies about talking cats, and being a boyband. Eventually, Chris has enough of Sierra and tells her to zip it. Team Amazon wins the first part, later discovering the only way to go down is to slide down a fireman's pole. During the second part, the contestants race to Central Park, New York going through a sewer and end up being chased by a giant alligator who tries to eat them. Team Victory won the second part giving them the shortest path. The second challenge involved the teams pushing their carriges along a pre-deterimied path to turtle pond and bobbing for giant apples with only their heads and loading the carriges. Afterwards, teams have to race to the heart of New York. During the challenge, one member of each team had to stay in the carrige (Cody, Lindsy, and Noah) and sing during while racing. DJ this time hurts a turtle. During the challenge, Heather switches Team CRRRH's carriage with a real carriage. They got to the heart first but lost because of Heather. In the end Team Amazon won once again. The prizes were candy (which Cody greedily started taking), apples (which Sierra wanted to thank Chris for), and an electric meat grinder (which Heather threw out of the plane).

Alejandro and Cody engage in a tie-breaker to determine a spot in the final two, and with one last manipulation from Alejandro, Cody gets eliminated. Chris then announces the final challenge with Heather against Alejandro which involves climbing Hawaii's active volcano with a wooden dummy of your opponent. During the challenge, Cody and Harold volunteer to help Heather, while Lindsay and Courtney choose to help Alejandro. In the end, Heather manages to trick Alejandro (by saying that she loves him), which distracts Alejandro, giving Heather the opportunity to bring Alejandro to his ultimate downfall in the game. However, after a misunderstanding, Alejandro still gets the win, after Heather throws Alejandro's dummy into the volcano. Later on, Ezekiel reemerges and steals the million dollar case from Chris, but then falls into the volcano (similar to the death of Gollum from The Lord of the Rings), and nobody gets the million dollars. The volcano then erupts, potentially harming everyone present, and Alejandro is the only one who suffers major injuries caused by the volcano's lava. Alejandro is then put inside a robot by Chef and Chris due to his extensive injuries, an obvious parody of the creation of Darth Vader from Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.
